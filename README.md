WoW-Addons-Backup

About:
I needed a script that created a backup of my World of Warcraft addons along with their interface and configs which would include the WTF folder. I also needed the backup in several places and compressed. Thus this simple batch script was born!
It needs a lot of work but hopefully will work out in the long run!

I will be updating as it gets more and more complicated along with other little scripts that could help doing other things too. Some tutorials wills also be here.
